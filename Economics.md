## Economics

### FX

#### PPP

- **Absolute PPP** - FX is determined purely by **price level**.

- **Relative PPP** - percentage change in the spot exchange rate (%ΔS*f/d*) will be completely determined by the difference between foreign and domestic inflation rates (Π*f* -Π*d*) 

    FX is determined by **Inflation rate**.

- **Ex ante PPP** - FX is determined by **Expected Inflation not actual inflation**.

#### Spread of Ask-bid

- Large trade would increase the spread.
    -  **Transaction size** can affect the bid–offer spread. **Wider spreads on larger trades reflect the greater difficulty the dealer faces in “laying off” the FX risk in the interbank market.**
- Credit Rating.
    - A client’s credit risk can be a factor because a client with a **poor credit profile may be quoted a wider bid–offer spread** than one with good credit, reflecting the greater settlement risk.
    - If has other choice, credit rating is **not the most important** factor in deterring the spread
- Currency Pair
    - Popularity of currencies in the pair would matter.


#### Current Account Imbalances and the Determination of Exchange Rates

Three Channels

- The Flow Supply/Demand Channel

    **Bases on purchases and sales** of internationally traded goods and services require the exchange of domestic and foreign currencies in order to arrange payment for those goods and services. 

- The Portfolio Balance Channel

    Current account imbalances shift financial wealth from deficit nations to surplus nations. **Countries with trade deficits will finance their trade with increased borrowing.** This behaviour may lead to shifts in global asset preferences, which in turn could influence the path of exchange rates.

    For example, nations running large current account surpluses versus the United States might find that their holdings of US dollar–denominated assets exceed the amount they desire to hold in a portfolio context. Actions they might take to reduce their dollar holdings to desired levels could then have a profound negative impact on the dollar’s value.

- The Debt Sustainability Channel

    According to this mechanism, there should be some **upper limit on the ability of countries to run persistently large current account deficits**. **If a country runs a large and persistent current account deficit over time, eventually it will experience an untenable rise in debt owed to foreign investors. If such investors believe that the deficit country’s external debt is rising to unsustainable levels, they are likely to reason that a major depreciation of the deficit country’s currency will be required at some point to ensure that the current account deficit narrows significantly and that the external debt stabilises at a level deemed sustainable.**

    The existence of persistent current account imbalances will tend to alter the market’s notion of what exchange rate level represents the true, **long-run equilibrium value**. For deficit nations, ever-rising net external debt levels as a percentage of GDP should give rise to steady (but not necessarily smooth) downward revisions in market expectations of the currency’s long-run equilibrium value. For surplus countries, ever-rising net external asset levels as a percentage of GDP should give rise to steady upward revisions of the currency’s long-run equilibrium value. Hence, one would expect currency values to move broadly in line with trends in debt and/or asset accumulation.

#### Exchange Rate Determination Models

- **Mundell-Fleming Model**

    https://policonomics.com/is-lm-bp/

    States that Monetary and Fiscal Policy affect the level of interest, economic activities, etc and finally affect the exchange rate.

    **Similar to IS-LM**

    , with IS: $Y=c(Y-T) +I(r)+G+NX(e)$

    ​		LM: $\frac{M}{Y} = L(r,y)\to L(e,y)$

    [![General Equilibrium in MF Model](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clip_image005_thumb30.jpg)](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clip_image00526.jpg)

    [![Mundell-Fleming Model](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clip_image007_thumb28.jpg)](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clip_image00722.jpg)

    - Fiscal Policy move the output, so shift the IS curve.
    - Monetary Policy move the Monetary Supply/Demand and interest rate, so shifts the LM curve.

- **Monetary Model**

    Compared to the Mundell-Fleming model that monetary policy is transmitted to the exchange rate through its impact on interest rates and output. Changes in the price level and/or the inflation rate play no role. **Monetary models** of exchange rate determination generally take the opposite perspective: Output is fixed and **monetary policy affects exchange rates first and foremost through the price level and the rate of inflation.**

    - **Pure Monetary Model**

        The monetary approach asserts that an X% rise in the domestic **money supply** will produce an X% **rise** in the **domestic price level**. Drawback is assuming PPP holds in short & medium term. 但是price level一般只有在长期可变（menu cost）。

    - **Dornbusch Overshooting Model**

        Prices have limited flexibility in the short run but are fully flexible in the long run. 基于假设price level fixed in the short run. So exchange rate overshoots.

        According to Dornbusch, with inflexible domestic prices in the short run, any decrease in nominal money supply will induce an increase in the domestic interest rate. This will encourage capital inflows and cause the exchange rate to overshoot to the upside in the short run, until domestic prices have a chance to react.

    - **Portfolio Balance (Asset Market) Models**

        Compare Mundell-Fleming model with portfolio balance model 

        - The Mundell-Fleming Model is essentially a short-run model of exchange rate determination.

        - Portfolio balance model makes allowance for the long-term effects of budgetary imbalances that typically arise from sustained fiscal policy actions.
        - This model states that **growing government budget deficit leads to a steady increase in the supply of domestic bonds outstanding**. **In the long run, governments that run large budget deficits on a sustained basis could eventually see their currencies decline in value.**

### Growth

$$Y=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$$

, take log, $logY = logA + \alpha logK+\alpha log L$, and then differentiates,

$$\frac{dY}{Y}=\frac{dA}{A}+\alpha \frac{dK}{K}+(1-\alpha)\frac{dL}{L}$$

So, we get the Labour Productivity Growth Accounting eqn: (Capital Deepening)

Growth rate in potential GDP = long-term growth rate of labor force + long-term growth rate in labor productivity.

#### Per Capita Version

$$y=Ak^{\alpha}$$

, where $k=\frac{K}{L}$, the per capital capital. The increase in $k$ is called the **capital deepening**.

Then, we take log, $log(y)=log(A)+\alpha  log(k)$, and differentiates it,

$$\frac{dy}{y}=\frac{dA}{A}+\alpha \frac{dk}{k}$$

- the **tax** rate is unlikely to be an impediment to growth, so lowering the tax rate is **not** likely to be a major contributor to growth.

#### Growth Theory

- Classical Growth Theory

    **Per capita GDP growth are temporary** because the resulting population explosion will lower per capita GDP to subsistence real wage levels. 

- Neoclassical Growth Theory 

    Steady State (BGP): see my blog: https://eightsmilefy.com/?p=2018

    - $\dot{K} : n+g$
    - $\dot{Y}: n+g$
    - $\dot{k} =\frac{K}{AL},\quad  \dot{y}=\frac{Y}{AL} = 0$
    - $\dot{L}=n,\quad \dot{A}=g$
    - $y=Ak^{\alpha}$, so, $\frac{\Delta y}{y}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}+\alpha \frac{\Delta k}{k}$. As $\frac{\Delta y}{y}=\frac{\Delta k}{k}$, then $(1-\alpha)\frac{\Delta y}{y}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}$
      - $g=\frac{\Delta y}{y}=\frac{\Delta k}{k}=\frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}$. 
      - The equilibrium sustainable growth rate of output per capita is $g$.

- Endogenous Growth Theory

    - There is a sustainable growth, $A(k)$. With the growth of per capita capital, technological progress improves as well.
    - Does not necessarily converge to a steady state rate of growth.
    - Unlike the neoclassical model, **there are no diminishing marginal returns to capital** for the economy as a whole in the endogenous growth model. The endogenous growth model allows for the possibility of constant or even **increasing returns to capital** in the aggregate economy.
    - So increasing the saving rate **permanently** increases the rate of economic growth.

#### Convergency

- Absolute Convergence Hypothesis

    - Assuming the neoclassical model assumes that **all countries have access to the same technology**. Then, as a result, **per capita income in all countries should eventually grow at the same rate**. Thus, the model implies **convergence of per capita growth rates** among all countries.

        However, it does **not** imply the **level** of per capita income will be the same in all countries.

- Conditional convergence hypothesis

    - Convergence is **conditional on** the countries having the same **saving rate, population growth rate, and production function**.
    - **If these conditions hold, the neoclassical model** implies **convergence** to the same **level** of per capita output as well as the same steady state growth **rate**.

- Club convergence hypothesis

### Regulation

- **Government-backed** regulatory bodies 由政府给权利
  
    - governmental departments and agencies: Enforce & Enact 有政府权力，有政府的钱
    - Independent regulator: but **not government agency** - do not rely on government funding. 有政府的enact，但没有政府的funding
    
        Is given its power to enforce regulations by government statute, yet it is not funded by the government, making it an independent regulator.
- Industry Self-regulatory Body (SRB) 是private没有政府权力，没有政府funding，自己在industry筹钱 
  
    行业协会 - 如CFA Institute
    
    - Independent of Gov
    - Derive authority from members
    - Not have the force of law (因为不是gov)
    
- SROs (self-regulating organisation) 本质上是private，但是有政府的权利，没政府funding
    - Not Industry Self-regulatory Body, because they have enforcement power.
    - is given legal authority by the government to enforce the new statute.
    - has member companies that accept the authorisation to set and enforce rules and standards.
    - Funded Independently.
    - **SROs differ from standard industry self-regulatory bodies in that they are given recognition and authority, including enforcement power, by a government body or agency.** SROs are funded independently, rather than by the government. 

#### Regulatory Interdependency

- **Regulatory Capture Theory**

    Regulated **companies fight against new proposed regulations**.

- **Regulatory Competition**

    **Regulators may compete** to provide a regulatory environment designed to attract certain entities.

- **Regulatory Arbitrage**

    Entities may identify and use some aspect of regulations that **allows them to exploit differences** in economic substance and regulatory interpretation or in foreign and domestic regulatory regimes to their (the entities’) benefit.

- **Coase Theorem** 

    The Coase theorem states that **if an externality can be traded and there are no transaction costs**, then the allocation of property rights will be **efficient** and the resource allocation will not depend on the initial assignment of property rights

#### BEI (Break-Even Inflation)

Break-even inflation is the difference between the nominal yield on a fixed-rate investment and the real yield (fixed spread) on an inflation-linked investment of similar maturity and credit quality. If inflation averages more than the break-even, the inflation-linked investment will outperform the fixed-rate. Conversely, if inflation averages below the break-even, the fixed-rate will outperform the inflation-linked.

Calculation Formula:

Comparable Fixed-Rate – Inflation-Linked Real Yield = Break-Even Inflation

Calculation Example: $BEI = NominalBond - RealBond$

A zero-coupon default-free **nominal bond** and on a zero-coupon default-free **real bond** of the same maturity is known as the break-even inflation (BEI) rate

#### Taylor Rule

$PolicyRate = r + \pi + \frac{1}{2}(\pi - \pi^*)+\frac{1}{2}(y-\bar{y})$

$Policy Rate = realR + Inf + 0.5(ActInf-ExpedInf)+0.5(ActGDP - Potential GDP)$

相比于 nominal rate, policy rate如果真实inf高，加息，如果positive output gap，加息。

- $r$ - real interest rate
- $\pi$ - actual inflation rate 
- $\pi^*$ - target inflation rate
- $y$ - real GDP
- $\bar{y}$ - potential GDP
- $r+\pi$ - together is the neutral rate
