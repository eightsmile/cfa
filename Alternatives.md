## Alternatives

### Real Estate

#### Valuation Approach 

- Cost Approach, Property Value = Land + Building Replacement Cost - TotalDepreciation - Obsolescence - Deterioration
- Sales Comparison
- Income Approach
    - Direct Capitalisation 用第一个月的  $\frac{NOI}{r-g} $
    - DCF

#### Loan Amount

- Loan to Value ratio $=\frac{Loan}{Value}$
- debt service coverage ratio $=\frac{NOI}{Debt Interest Expense}$

用以上两个反推

#### Others

- Shopping centres - require more management, such as tenant mix and promotion
    - A shopping centres is a type of **retail property**. A percentage lease is a unique aspect of many retail leases, which requires the tenant to pay additional rent once its sales reach a certain level. The lease will typically specify a “**minimum rent**” that must be paid regardless of the tenant’s sales. **Percentage rent** may be paid by the tenant once the tenant’s sales reach a certain level or breakpoint.

#### Absolute Valuation

Net Asset Value, $NAV = \frac{NOI_{1}}{cap\ rate}+Cash-Debt$ / # of shares

直接用下一期的 NOI / Cap Rate 

+Cash

-Debt

#### Relative Value Approach

- FFO ( funds from operations ) $=NetIncome + Loss+DepAmt$
- AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operations) =
    - FFO 
    - **Minus** Non-Cash Rent Adjustment 
    - **Minus** Recurring Maintenance-type Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions.
    
    Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) is a refinement of funds from operations (FFO), **which takes into consideration the leasing and maintenance-type capital expenditures necessary to maintain the economic income of a property.** 减掉了，所以考虑了
    
    - It is, however, **subject to more variation and error in estimation than FFO.** 
    - Used to give a more accurate description about the current economic condition.

#### Types

- CMBS - asset-backed securitised **debt** obligations that receive cash flow from portfolios of mortgage loans.
- REITs - own properties that are income producing.
    - REIT分为 Equity REITs 和 Mortgage / Debts REITs
    - Equity type 直接 own buildings。
    - Mortgage types 持有 debts

- REOCs - Real estate operating companies generate cash inflows primarily from the **sale of developed or improved properties,** as opposed to recurring lease or rental income.
- **Industrial REITs** is sensitive to **retail sales**; **Storage REITs** is sensitive to **Population growth**

### VC & LBOs

#### Characteristics

| **Venture Capital**                                          | **Buyout**                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primarily equity funded. Use of **leverage is rare and very limited.** | Extensive use of leverage consisting of a large proportion of senior debt and a significant layer of junior and/or mezzanine debt. |
| Returns of investment portfolios are generally characterized by very high returns from a limited number of highly successful investments and a significant number of write-offs from low performing investments or failures. | Returns of investment portfolios are generally characterised by lower variance across returns from underlying investments. **Bankruptcies are rare events.** |
| Venture capital firm monitors achievement of milestones defined in business plan and growth management. | Buyout firm monitors cash flow management and strategic and business planning. Buyout funds seek out companies with **stable cash flows.** |
| **Expanding capital requirement** if in the growth phase.    | **Low working capital requirement.**                         |
| Assessment of risk is difficult because of new technologies, new markets, and lack of operating history. | Risk is measurable (e.g., mature businesses, long operating history, etc.). |
| **Buy from Existed Shareholders**                            | Buyout funds acquire most portfolio companies **via auction**, involving multiple potential acquirers. |
| **获得minority shares**                                      | the entire equity capital is acquired by the private equity purchasers |

#### Performance Calculations

- TVPI, Total Value to Paid-in Capital， $ TVPI=\frac{Distributed + UnDistributed}{Cumulative InvestedCapital}$
- DPI, Distributed to Paid-in Capital， $DPI=\frac{Cumulative Distributions}{Cumulated InvestedCapital}$ - 分配出去的 - **Realised Return**. 包括今年分配的，去年分配的，etc所以以前分配的都加一起
- RVPI, Residual Value to Paid-in Capital, $RVPI = \frac{NAV(afterDistribution)}{Cumulative Invested Capital}$ - **Unrealised Return** 为当年剩下的NAV after distribution
- TVPI = DPI + RVPI
- High Water Mark - Carry Interest 跟此前最高的比的 diff * rate

#### Buyout

Buyout funds seek out companies with **stable cash flows**. 

- invest in companies with **low working capital requirements** and 
- **acquire portfolio companies via auction**, involving multiple potential acquirers.

#### PE

**Valuation Creation**: Rather than ownership and control being separate, as in most publicly quoted companies, **private equity concentrates ownership and control.** Key points:

- (1) the ability to **re-engineer** the private firm to generate superior returns, 

- (2) financial leverage and the ability to **access credit markets on favourable terms**, and 

- (3) a better alignment of interests between private equity firm owners and the managers of the firms they control.

- Private equity funds **increase value by taking on high levels of debt on favourable terms**. They are able to **offset their borrowing costs by superior reorganisation and re-engineering capabilities**. 

    可以以低成本leverage，通过re-engineer 带来的return，对冲 leverage的成本

#### Multiples

- **DPI** (Disposable Personal Income实收已经分到的钱，包含历史多期已经收到的钱) 

     DPI = Cumulative distributions / Cumulative invested capital 

     , which provides an indication of a fund’s realised return, 

- **RVPI** (Residual Value to Paid-in-Capital, **Unrealised部分**因为未卖出，所以还呈现为unrealised gain/L的NAV形式. 实缴资本的剩余价值,是基金的剩余价值与实缴资本的比率) 

     RVPI = NAV (after distributions) / Cumulative invested capital

     , which provides an indication of a fund’s unrealised return. 

- TPI = DPI + RVPI

### Commodities

#### Types

- Contango: Upward
- backward: future price downward - theory of storage

#### Theories

- **Insurance theory** - about Insurance

    predicts that the futures price has to be **lower** than the current spot price as a form of payment or remuneration to the speculator who takes on the price risk and provides price **insurance** to the commodity seller. 

    future小于current，因为持有commodity提供了insurance

- **Theory of Storage** - about Holding

    - When available inventory levels **(supply) of the commodity are high**, the buyers of that commodity keep their levels to the minimum. **Futures prices tend to be in  contango**. **The volatility of spot and futures prices tend to be low, and equal.**
    - When available inventory levels of the commodity are low (Scarcity), buyers of the commodity tend to stock up on the good. **Futures prices tend to be in backwardation.** **The volatility of nearby futures prices are raised** compared with the volatility of long term futures prices.
    - Storage Cost 大 -> future price 大
    - Convenience Yield 大 -> future price 小

- **Hedging Pressure Hypothesis** - about Hedge

    hedging pressure occurs when both producers and consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilise their projected profits and cash flows. **If consumers are more interested in hedging than producers are, the futures price will exceed the spot price.**

    - 买多 contango
    - 卖short多 backwardation

#### Calculation

For a long position, the total return consists of the price return ((current price – previous price)/previous price) plus the roll return ((near-term contract price – farther-term contract price)/near-term price) plus the collateral return. For a short position, it is the negative of the first two terms.

$$Total R = Price R + Roll R + CollateralR$$

$$TotalR = \frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0} + \frac{F_0-F_1}{F_0} + collateralR \times \%$$

- Total Return = Price Return + Roll Return + Collateral Return
    -  Roll return 期货合同到期后续作新的时，挣的钱 $=\frac{F_0 - F_1}{F_0}$. $F_0$ 为到期的，$F_1$ 为续作的。
    -  $Roll return = \frac{\text{Near-term futures contract closing price} −\text{ Farther-term futures contract closing price}}{\text{Near-term futures contract closing price}}$
        -  So, positive Calendar Spread & Roll Return for backwardation.
    -  $Total Return = Price Return + RollReturn + Collateral Return$
        -  $Price Reture = \frac{F_0-P}{F_0}$, 在t-1时刻进入future contract 价格为F_0，当前价格为P，所以Price Return 为挣得差价
        -  $RollReturn = \frac{F_0-F_1}{F_0}$，续作现在的future contract。未来的future price F_0 减去 现在的future price F_1 注意是 近的 减 远的
        -  Collateral Return = Annual rate × Period length as a fraction of the year
    
- Calendar Spread = Near Future - Long Future
    - A **positive calendar spread i**s associated with futures markets that are in **backwardation**, whereas a negative calendar spread is associated with futures markets that are in contango. Lumber futures have successively higher prices and are in contango.
    
- Basis = Near Spread - Spot

- **People are confusing the long position with short position, in case of backwardation, long position would create positive roll returns but short position would end up with negative roll returns.**
