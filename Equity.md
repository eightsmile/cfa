### DDM

#### PVGO

Present Value of Growth Opportunities (PVGO)

As $PV= \frac{E_1}{r-g}$, so,

$$PV - PVGO =\frac{E_1}{r}$$

#### P/E

- Leading PE = $\frac{P}{E_1}$
- Trailing PE = $\frac{P}{E_0}$

Leading P/E thus is,

$$ \frac{PV}{E_1} - \frac{PVGO}{E_1}=\frac{1}{r} $$

, with the growth component is the First Part on RHS.

$$ PV = PVGO + \frac{E_1}{r} $$

注意是$E_1$ 不是 $Div_1$

Leading PE: $\frac{P}{E_1} = \frac{D_1/(r-g)}{E_1}=\frac{PayoutRatio}{r-g}$

#### H-Model

$$V_0 = \frac{D_0(1+g_2)}{r-g_2}+\frac{D_0H(g_1-g_2)}{r-g_2}$$

- $g_1$ - initial high growth rate.
- $g_2$ - terminal growth rate.
- $H$ - The half-life of the high growth period.

Under the H-model, the growth rate drops **linearly** until it hits the terminal growth rate. Growth rate change in a **linear / steady rate**.

- DDM is most **suitable** when an investor takes a **noncontrol perspective** because he does **not** have the ability to meaningfully influence the timing or magnitude of a company’s **cash flows and is therefore reliant on dividend policy.** 
- DCF could be used for controlling interest.
