### Personal Information (get to know)

- **Family situation**: martial status, # of Children, ages of family member
- **ID**
- **Employment and Career info**
- **Sources of wealth**: wage earned, inheritance
- **Investment Background**: Return, Liquidity, ESG
- **Financial Objectives and Risk Tolerance**

Asset 不能 cover Liability 的方法

1. 增加A：少消费，多存钱。cash  & deposit accounts surplus
2. 减少Lia：减少负债
3. 增长率：资产的增长率 超过高 lia的 $g_A>g_L$

#### Tax Consideration

- **Common Tax Categories**
    1. **Taxes on Income**
    2. **Wealth-based Taxes**: Property, Real Estate, Taxes of Transfer of Wealth ( inheritance )
    3. **Taxes on Consumption / Spending**: Sales Taxes & Value-added Taxes
- **Basic Tax Strategies**
    1. Tax Avoidance 避税
    2. Tax Reduction 减税
    3. Tax Deferral ( interim earning e.g. coupon 不用 pay tax，所以不会因为tax减少compounding的数额)
- Other Information needed to Know
    - Estate Plan
    - Life Insurance, Excess Liability Coverage, and other insurance coverage

#### Client Goals

- **Planned Goals**

    Can be estimated or Quantified

    1. retirement
    2. Specific purchase: such as buy car at a certain year
    3. Education
    4. Wealth transfer (inheritance)
    5. Philanthropy 慈善捐赠 charitable donations

- **Unplanned Goals**

    1. Property Repairs 买房屋保险 insurance 面对 catastrophes （不一定有，有房子或者有买房意愿才有）
    2. Medical Expense 一定有

- Fund Manager should consider also **(1) goal quantification (2) goal prioritisation (3) goal changes**

#### Risk Tolerance

- Willingness 承担风险的意愿（Risk Tolerance）: investment style, psychological profile, self-statement
- Ability 承担风险的能力（risk capacity）：Time Horizon, Relative Portfolio Size (Spending Needs / Portfolio $\approx < 8%$)
- 如果willingness & ability 都高，则 risk tolerance 高
- 如果有一个低或者都低，就跟低的走

### Investment Planing

#### Evaluating Capital Sufficiency 判断投资是否能满足capital 需求

1. Deterministic Forecast Method

    Assume a straight-line manner

    The process is simple, but the assumption is unrealistic

2. Monte Carlo Simulation

    Assume probability distributions

    Get the **percentage of trails by horizon** in which client can achieve the object

#### Retirement Planning

- Analyse the Retirement Goals

    1. Mortality Table 概率和寿命 加权平均算出预期平均寿命。用年数把未来现金流折现

        - Drawbacks: 

            1. Individual prob of living might exceed the general population 个人数据可能与大样本不一样
            2. Cannot model different scenarios

            ![Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 13.30.33](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eightsmile/ImageLib@main/Screenshot%202023-11-20%20at%2013.30.33.png)

    2. Annuities 直接按 保险公司的 fixed payment 算

        - Drawbacks: 

            1. fixed payment each year 与实际情况不相符
            2. Cannot model different scenarios

            ![Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 13.31.47](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eightsmile/ImageLib@main/Screenshot%202023-11-20%20at%2013.31.47.png)

    3. Monte Carlo Simulation

        Aggregate the results of many trails 

        Based on Assumption, so it's flexible

        - Drawbacks:

            1. cannot predict future, it's only the estimation

            2. Sensitive to changes in assumption
            3. Not necessary the shortfall magnitude ？wtf

- Behavioural Consideration in Retirement Planning

    1. Heightened Loss Aversion 相比于gain，更讨厌loss
    2. Consumption Gap 实际开销与预期不同
    3. Annuity Puzzle 不喜欢投资annuity 因为觉得保险公司都是sb，不如自己投资
    4. Preference for Investment Income over Capital Appreciation 相比于capital gain更喜欢 coupon 和 dividends更喜欢稳定的income 收入

### IPS (Investment Policy Statement)

1. **Background and Investment Objectives (R, for Return)**

   1. **Clearify the objectives**

      know the background Information, (name, age, personal financial info, etc). Retirement, family member etc

   2. the investment objectives should be **detailed and quantified** Prioritise the Objectives Conduct Capacity sufficiency Analysis

   3. **capital sufficiency analysis, revise the objectiv**e

   4. **IPS should include the market value of the portfolio and of the accounts that make uo the portfolio** (Taxable, TDA)

   5. **any other investment assets** (timberland)

   6. **Any cash flows from external sources** (trust / inheritance)

2. **Investment Parameters (RTTLLU, r for risks)**

   1. RIsk Tolerance (willingness and ability)
   2. Investment Time Horizon, (might be a range not a number)
   3. Asset Class Preferences
   4. Other Investment Preference (ESG, or Legacy, endownment bias)
   5. Liquidty Preference
   6.  Constraints

3. **Portfolio Asset Allocation (SAA, TAA)**

   1. Strategic AA  (long-term), define the target allocation and upper / lower bonds
   2. Tactic AA (short-term), class target ranges not specific percentage

4. **Portfolio Management (Discretionary or Passive)**

   1. Discretionary 可以自主决策的百分比
   2. Reblancing 将当期情况，向 target 调整
   3. Tactical Changes 什么时候能偏离 SAA
   4. Implementation: investment vehicles

5. **Duties and Responsibilities**

   1. wealth management responsibilities
   2. IPS review

6. **IPS Appendix (Simulation)**

### Portfolio Construction and Monitoring
