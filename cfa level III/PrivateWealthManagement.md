### Personal Information (get to know)

- **Family situation**: martial status, # of Children, ages of family member
- **ID**
- **Employment and Career info**
- **Sources of wealth**: wage earned, inheritance
- **Investment Background**: Return, Liquidity, ESG
- **Financial Objectives and Risk Tolerance**

#### Financial Information

Asset 不能 cover Liability 的方法

1. 增加A：少消费，多存钱。cash  & deposit accounts surplus
2. 减少Lia：减少负债
3. 增长率：资产的增长率 超过高 lia的 $g_A>g_L$

#### Tax Consideration

- **Common Tax Categories**
    1. **Taxes on Income**
    2. **Wealth-based Taxes**: Property, Real Estate, Taxes of Transfer of Wealth ( inheritance )
    3. **Taxes on Consumption / Spending**: Sales Taxes & Value-added Taxes
- **Basic Tax Strategies**
    1. Tax Avoidance 避税
    2. Tax Reduction 减税
    3. Tax Deferral ( interim earning e.g. coupon 不用 pay tax，所以不会因为tax减少compounding的数额)
- Other Information needed to Know
    - Estate Plan
    - Life Insurance, Excess Liability Coverage, and other insurance coverage

#### Client Goals

- **Planned Goals**

    Can be estimated or Quantified

    1. retirement
    2. Specific purchase: such as buy car at a certain year
    3. Education
    4. Wealth transfer (inheritance)
    5. Philanthropy 慈善捐赠 charitable donations

- **Unplanned Goals**

    1. Property Repairs 买房屋保险 insurance 面对 catastrophes （不一定有，有房子或者有买房意愿才有）
    2. Medical Expense 一定有

- Fund Manager should consider also **(1) goal quantification (2) goal prioritisation (3) goal changes**

#### Risk Tolerance

- Willingness 承担风险的意愿（Risk Tolerance）: investment style, psychological profile, self-statement
- Ability 承担风险的能力（risk capacity）：Time Horizon, Relative Portfolio Size (Spending Needs / Portfolio $\approx < 8%$)
- 如果willingness & ability 都高，则 risk tolerance 高
- 如果有一个低或者都低，就跟低的走

### Investment Planing

#### Evaluating Capital Sufficiency 判断投资是否能满足capital 需求

1. Deterministic Forecast Method

    Assume a straight-line manner

    The process is simple, but the assumption is unrealistic

2. Monte Carlo Simulation

    Assume probability distributions

    Get the **percentage of trails by horizon** in which client can achieve the object

#### Retirement Planning

- Analyse the Retirement Goals

    1. Mortality Table 概率和寿命 加权平均算出预期平均寿命。用年数把未来现金流折现

        - Drawbacks: 

            1. Individual prob of living might exceed the general population 个人数据可能与大样本不一样
            2. Cannot model different scenarios

            ![Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 13.30.33](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eightsmile/ImageLib@main/Screenshot%202023-11-20%20at%2013.30.33.png)

    2. Annuities 直接按 保险公司的 fixed payment 算

        - Drawbacks: 

            1. fixed payment each year 与实际情况不相符
            2. Cannot model different scenarios

            ![Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 13.31.47](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eightsmile/ImageLib@main/Screenshot%202023-11-20%20at%2013.31.47.png)

    3. Monte Carlo Simulation

        Aggregate the results of many trails 

        Based on Assumption, so it's flexible

        - Drawbacks:

            1. cannot predict future, it's only the estimation

            2. Sensitive to changes in assumption
            3. Not necessary the shortfall magnitude ？wtf

- Behavioural Consideration in Retirement Planning

    1. Heightened Loss Aversion 相比于gain，更讨厌loss
    2. Consumption Gap 实际开销与预期不同
    3. Annuity Puzzle 不喜欢投资annuity 因为觉得保险公司都是sb，不如自己投资
    4. Preference for Investment Income over Capital Appreciation 相比于capital gain更喜欢 coupon 和 dividends更喜欢稳定的income 收入

### IPS (Investment Policy Statement)

1. **Background and Investment Objectives (R, for Return)**

   1. **Clearify the objectives**

      know the background Information, (name, age, personal financial info, etc). Retirement, family member etc

   2. the investment objectives should be **detailed and quantified** Prioritise the Objectives Conduct Capacity sufficiency Analysis

   3. **capital sufficiency analysis, revise the objectiv**e

   4. **IPS should include the market value of the portfolio and of the accounts that make uo the portfolio** (Taxable, TDA)

   5. **any other investment assets** (timberland)

   6. **Any cash flows from external sources** (trust / inheritance)

2. **Investment Parameters (RTTLLU, r for risks)**

   1. RIsk Tolerance (willingness and ability)
   2. Investment Time Horizon, (might be a range not a number)
   3. Asset Class Preferences
   4. Other Investment Preference (ESG, or Legacy, endownment bias)
   5. Liquidty Preference
   6.  Constraints

3. **Portfolio Asset Allocation (SAA, TAA)**

   1. Strategic AA  (long-term), define the target allocation and upper / lower bonds
   2. Tactic AA (short-term), class target ranges not specific percentage

4. **Portfolio Management (Discretionary or Passive)**

   1. Discretionary 可以自主决策的百分比
   2. Reblancing 将当期情况，向 target 调整
   3. Tactical Changes 什么时候能偏离 SAA
   4. Implementation: investment vehicles

5. **Duties and Responsibilities**

   1. wealth management responsibilities
   2. IPS review

6. **IPS Appendix (Simulation)**

### Portfolio Construction and Monitoring

- Portfolio Construction

  1. Traditional Approach: MVO, etc
  2. Goals Based Approach: 详见AA

- Portfoio Reporting and Review <- periodically (monthly) review

  here below is what should be reported

  - Report
    1. Strategic Asset Allocation Target
    2. Performance Summary during the current period
    3. Detailed performance report (asset class and individual securities)
    4. Historical Performance Report
    5. Contribution and Withdrawl
    6. Purchase and Sales
    7. Currency Exposure
  - Review
    - Review 是否 满足 clients' objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon
    - AA 是否一致

- Evaluation of Success or Achievement

  1. Goal Achievement: 是否 meet the long-term objectives
  2. Process Consistency 真实流程与设计流程是否一致
     - third-party fund managers' performance relative to benchmark
     - reduce cost
     - taxation isses
     - etc
  3. Portfolio Performance (absolute & relative)
  4. definition of success 如果前3点都不达成，被判定为 success

### Ethical and Compliance Consideration (不重要)

- Fiduciary Duty
- Know Your Customer (KYC)
- Confidentiality
- Conflicts of Interests

### Private Client Segments 给个人投资者分类

## Taxation

### Tax Classes

- Income Tax = % of taxable income

- Gain Tax: based on price appreciation (capital gain)

- Wealth or Property Tax: tax on the Real Estate

- Stamp Duties: on the process of purchasing equity or properties 

    - 相当于邮票，有这个流程，需要贴个stamp的税

    - 外国人的 比 本国人的贵

- Wealth Transfer Tax

    - estate or inheritance

Scenario

- Double Taxation (,income is taxed twice 收入被税两次)
- Qualified Dividends: In the U.S., if common stock is held for at least 60 days, then lower tax rate
- Cross-border investments: withholding taxes 预扣税

Capital Gain Taxes

- Tax Basis = price * # + all related other costs
- Step-up on Death: 拿 inheritance 时，tax basis 调整为 fair market value of the asset

Tax Jurisdiction

- Tax haven: no tax for foreign investors
- Territorial Tax System: only locally-sourced income is tax 只有本地的tax
- Worldwide Tax System: all income regardless the source 不管人在哪，只要有收入就征税 产生 double-taxation
    - Residence Rules 用于判定人是哪个国家的 taxable resident
    - 当一个人属于多个国家时，Tax Treaties  (tie-breaker rules) 防止全额的 double-taxation，部分减少税

### Tax Efficiency

- Equity is more tax efficient
    - Dividend receive preferential tax treatment
    - Capital Gain tax is lower 因为 capital gain 未实现的时候不交税
    - Flexible to sell
- Equity 比 Alternatives  derivatives 省税，
- Low turnover is more tax-efficient than high turnover
- Low yield is more tax-efficient than high yield
- Style-box approach is not tax efficient 这是的fund manager有特定的style范围，如果出了box of style 要rebalance or reconstitute，这个过程税多

#### Measurement

- After-tax Holding Period Return

    No consider tax: $R = \frac{V_1-V_0 +Income}{V_0}$

    Consider Tax: $R' = \frac{V_1-V_0 +Income- T}{V_0}$

    ​	$R' = R - \frac{T}{V_0}$

- Cumulative After Tax Return, $R_G$

    $(1+R'_1)\cdots(1+R'_n) = (1+R'_G)^n$

    $1+R'_G =\sqrt[n]{(1+R'_1)\cdots(1+R'_n) }$

- After-tax Post-liquidation Return, $R_{PL}$

    $1+R'_{PL} =\sqrt[n]{(1+R'_1)\cdots(1+R'_n) -\frac{Liquidation Tax}{Final Value}}$

    $LiquidationTax = (FinalValue-TaxBasis)\times t_{CapitalGain}$

- After-Tax Excess Return

    - $x=\text{Pre-tax excess return}=R-B$
    - $x'=\text{After-tax excess return}=R'-B'$
    - ,  where $R$ is the portfolio return, $B$ is the benchmark return. $R'$ is after-tax return, and $B'$ is the after-tax benchmark return
    - Tax Alpha = $x'-x $

- Tax-Efficiency Ratio (TER)

    $TER = \frac{R'}{R}=\frac{税后return}{税前return}$

    Not working is return is negative

### Tax-Aware Approaches to Planning

#### Three Accounts

三个阶段：放入，capital gain，取出

- Taxable Account: 交两次税，放入要交税，capital gain交税，取出不交税
- Tax-Deferred Account (TDA): 交一次税，只有取出时交withdraw tax
- Tax-Exempt Account (TEA): 交一次税，放入时交

- Value, FV
    - Taxable Account , $FV = (1+R')^n$ , $R'=R(1-t)$
    - TDA, $FV = (1+R)^n(1-t)$ 最后整体 (1-t)
    - TEA, $FV=(1+R)^n$, no tax

#### Asset Location

Rule of Thumb:

- Tax-Efficient Assets -> Taxable Account
- Tax-Inefficient Assets -> TEA or TDA

I.E.

- Equity -> Taxable Account 
    - 因为 equity本身就是 tax efficient，主要收益来自于 capital gain，capital gain本身就是realise时候交
    - 但如果 high turnover 那么就变成 tax-inefficient了，那么放入TDA TEA
- Bond -> TDA

#### Decumulation Strategies for a Retirement Account

- **Retirement Accounts are TEA or TDA**, so their compounding rate would not be s.t. tax, so higher rate of compounding

Therefore, **the rule of thumb**, withdrawals from the taxable account first and allow the retirement account to continue to compound.

先取taxable account的钱，因为retirement account 的钱 compound的快，所以后取

- **Under progressive tax regimes**, a more tax-efficient strategy may be to withdraw from the retirement account until the lowest tax brackets have been fully utilised. 在累积税率时，工资收入高，所以税率高，所以先取 retirement account 的话税高。而退休之后取税低

#### Assets for Charitable Giving

Gifts: Cash or Equity

- Appreciated securities can be gifted to a qualified charity without triggering the capital gain. 把 tax basis 最低的捐了，因为 capital gain = price - tax basis 大。charity可以免税
    - Gifting low-cost- basis assets from taxable accounts is preferred.

### Tax Management Strategies 如何进行税务管理

Tax avoidance 为合法避税， tax evasion 偷税 is illegal不合法

- Selection of Investment Vehicle

    1. Partnership (开办合伙制大企业，交个人税，不用交公司税。这样可以避免双重征税，先公司税后再个人税的问题)

    2. Mutual Funds 

        - Co-investors are influenced 所有人共同承担税务，因为赎回时，卖share 换钱，capital gain的部分将被税，所以shareholder都会被税

        - When new shareholders buy into the fund, they are also buying a share of the unrealised capital gains accrued in prior periods. 因为 fund manager的tax basis为最开始的price，所以中途买入的话，不管买入价是多少，tax basis都是最开始的值。

            所以最好买此前captial gain 升值少的 stocks

        - Potential Capital Gain Exposure

            $PCGE = \frac{Net\ G/L}{Total NetAsset}=\frac{gains - distribtuion-losses}{startPrice+(G-Distribution)}$

            这ratio越低越好，因为越低意味着gain少，所以**PCGE越小，tax efficiency越好**

    3. ETFs 可以在二级市场交易，所以只有赎回的人被税，其他shareholder不受影响

#### Tax Lot Accounting

track how much you paid when you bought it记录买入时的价格为 tax basis

The Tax Lot Method is for prioritising the realisation of G/L by

- FIFO 默认，但是由于一般first in 的tax basis 小，所以 tax inefficient 
- LIFO
- HIFO (highest in first out)
- Specified-lot method 指定选择

#### Tax Harvesting

realise a loss that can be used to **offset** gains or other income 用loss 的 stock 抵税

- To avoid the **wash sale rule** (为了抵税，卖了，再在31天内买回来) in the United States, you must **hold cash or some other security for 31 days**. There are **two issues**:
    1. Cash Drag 由于现金收益低，被拉低return
    2. 如果这31天用cash 买ETF，为了挣 return 的话，由于short holding period 所以 high capital gain tax
    3. **Tax Loss Harvesting** is tax-**deferral** strategy 
        - 相当于晚交税
        - 晚交的税 可以 compound

#### Quantitative Method

Set objective function to be used to minimize taxdrag and investment risk.

- Mini tracking error / min trading cost
- Max realised loss / min realised gain
- Etc

- Different Types of quantitative methods
    - Transitions: avoid realising taxes during holding period
    - Tax-Optimised Loss Harvesting: continuously look for losses harvesting opportunities
    - Gain-Loss Matching Optimisation
