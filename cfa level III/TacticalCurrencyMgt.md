### Tactical Currency Management

- Domestic Currency would appreciate if
    1. Long-run equilibrium **real exchange rate** increases
    2. Real and nominal **interest rate** increase
    3. Expected foreign inflation increase (so foreign currency depreciates)
    4. Foreign risks premium increase 

### Technical Analysis

- Golden Cross, Dead Cross
- Overbought or Oversold
- Support and Resistance levels cluster
    - Price gets sticky, gov control in the background. But, Once certain price points breached, the price would accelerate.

### Carry Trade

UIP & CIP

- on a longer-term average, the return on an unhedged foreign-currency asset investment will be the same as a domestic-currency investment.
- The yield spread advantage for the high-yielding currency (the right side of the equation) will, on average, be matched by the depreciation of the high-yield currency.

**However, in reality**, high-yield countries often see their currencies appreciate, not depreciate, for extended periods of time.
