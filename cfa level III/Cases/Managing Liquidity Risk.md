$Illiquid\ Asset\ Price = Marketable\ Asset\ Price - Put\ Price$

- Q: how futures and options can be used for leverage and liquidity purposes.

- A:  Taking a long futures position requires only minimal cash requirements for margin, which is a form of a leveraged investment. Therefore, any cash not required for margin can be used to invest in other assets with differing levels of liquidity, or to meet other liquidity requirements.

  Options can be purchased at premiums that are often only a fraction of the cost of the underlying asset, thereby serving as a form of leverage. Or, options can be sold to earn premium income that helps to generate liquidity.
