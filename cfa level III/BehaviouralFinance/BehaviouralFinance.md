## Behavioural Finance & Investment Process

### Classification of Investors into Types

- **Barnewall Two-way Model**

  - **Passive Investor**: accumulate wealth passively
    - Lower risk tolerance
    - the small the economic source, the more passive the investor is
  - **Active Investors**: actively involved in wealth creation
    - high RT
    - prefer to control own investments
    - if loss of control, RT reduce quickly

- **Bilard, Biehl, and Kaiser Five-way Model**

- The more emotional bias a person is, tell them more emotional things, "big picture", not statistical data.

- For cognitive error exposed investors, tell them reasons

#### Limitations of Classifying investors into BITs

- Individuals may simultaneously display **both emotional biases and cognitive errors**. 
- Individual might display traits **more than one behavioral investor type**.
- As investors age(ing), they will most likely go through behavioral changes. 会随年龄增长变
- Even in the same type, individuals should not be treated the same due to their **unique** circumstances and psychological traits. 每个人都不一样
- Individuals act **irrationally at different times and without predictability.**

#### Adviser–Client Relations

- RT (risk tolerance) questionnaires
  - 对 institutional investor 更有效，比 individual 
  - 对 cognitive bias 对投资者更有效，对比 emotional 。emotional的都是sb

#### Portfolio Construction

- **Inertia and Default**: Status quo 
- **Naïve Diversification**: Regret aversion 
- **Company Stock**: Familiar, overconfidence, Framing, Loyalty effects and status quo 
- **Excessive Trading**: Many biases. (e.g. overconfidence, regret of aversion etc) 
- **Home Bias**: Availability, illusion of control, endowment, and status quo, confirmation. 
- **Behavioral Portfolio Theory**: Mental account bias

#### Others

- Gamblers’ fallacy: a misunderstanding of probabilities in which people wrongly project reversal to a long-term mean, is a related cognitive bias.
- Hot hand fallacy: people affected by this fallacy wrongly project continuation of a recent trend.
- Social proof: individuals are biased to follow the beliefs of a group.
- Halo effect: extends a favorable evaluation of some characteristics to other characteristics.
- Home bias: portfolios exhibit a strong bias in favor of domestic securities.
