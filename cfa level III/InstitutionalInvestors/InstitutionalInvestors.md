### Investment Approaches

#### Norway Model (Sovereign Wealth Funds) 

因为是养老金，所以保守

- Traditional Style characterised by 60%/40% equity/fixed income. Few Alternatives, Large Passive Investment, tight tracking error limits
- Pros: low cost, high transparency, suitable for large scale
- Cons: limited valued-added potential 因为主要是 passive

#### Endowment Model (university endowment, SWF, DB) 原为Yale基金 

激进，外包

- High alternative exposure, active management and **outsourcing**
- Pros: high value-added potential
- Cons: high fess and high cost

#### Canada Model

激进，自己管in-hourse，internally managed。加拿大的养老金，但是也很active。

- High alternative Exposure, active management, **internally managed** (不同于 Yale外包，Canada都自己管in-house)
- 20% 投 reference part，如Norway的60/40 benchmark
- 剩下80%，
    1. 加入 active + alternative，使risks提升return提升
    2. 降低上市股%，提升PE%。两者exposure一致，但是return提升
- Pros: High value-added potential and development of internal capabilities. 
- Cons: Potentially expensive and difficult to manage.

#### Liability Driven Investment, LDI model (banks & insurers) 因为为DB用和银行用，所以比较保守，考虑资产如何覆盖负债

- focus on hedging liabilities and interest rate risk
- Pros: Explicit recognition of liabilities as part of the investment process.
- Cons: Certain risks (e.g., longevity risk, inflation risk) may not be hedged.

#### DB Plan

- Stakeholders 利益相关方

    - Plan sponsors (employers)

    - Plan beneficiary (employees and retirees)

    - Investment staff & investment committee

    - Government （1）设置税收优惠，鼓励investor把钱存入  pension plan。（2）政府为养老金兜底，如果pension plan毁约

        - Funded Status = FVA - PBO 

            正，表示net asset；负，表示net lia

- 影响 Liquidity needs 的因素

    - proportion of retired lives in the plan
    - Frozen plans
    - Workforce of the employer is older
    - Funded status 如果 fund status 为正，相当于 A > L，倾向于提出钱来，liquidity needs大
    - Ability to switch or withdraw
