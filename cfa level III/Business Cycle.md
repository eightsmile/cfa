## Business Cycle

### Phases

![Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eightsmile/ImageLib@main/Image.png)

#### 1. Initial Recovery 复苏期

- Gov stimulate the econ by lower interest, increease budget deficits.
  - **Falling interest rate**
- **Falling inflation**
- Negative output gap: Actual GDP < Potential GDP
- stock price increasing
- **Buy: risky assets such as small-cap stocks and high-yiedl bonds**

#### 2. Early Expansion 早期成长

- still low inflation
- increase in confidence
- **Short-term rate increasing**
  - **bond yield increase, so bond price decrease**
- output gap narrows
- **Buy: stocks**

#### 3. Late Expansion

- high confidence and high employment
- No Output Gap: Actual GDP > Potential GDP
- CB reduce the growth of Money Supply
  - Short-term rate increasing 
  - **bond yield increase, so bond price decrease**
  - **stock price achieve the top, sell stocks**

#### 4. Slowdown

- Inflation still Increase
- Short-term rate Peak
  - bond yield peak, bond price goes to the bottom
- Might have inverted yield curve, short-term rate > long term rate
- Buy: Bond as it achieves the bottom

#### 5. Contraction

- Low confidence and profits, low employment
- inflation top out
- Short-term rate faills
  - bond yield falls
- Stock price achieve the bottom at the end of recession, so buy stock then

### Inflation

- **Dis-inflation**: means inflation decrease, i.e. from 8% to 5%. Dis-inflation migh decelerate the econ. 但是因为inflation还是正的，price还在提升
- **Deflation**: negative inflation 是负的

**Deflation is worst!** in that, while asset price decrease (deflation), the balance sheet ends up with negative equity. Borrower cannot repay the interests, then **Default**!

1. Default on Debt Obligations
2. Monetary Policy not working, coz inflation negative drives interest rate negative.
   - QE to stimulste the econ
   - however, QE is working in the U.S. because the state of USD, but normally unable to work in other countries, such as CN and JP

| Business Cycle   | Inflation                                              | Economic Policy           | Markets                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initial recovery | Initially declining inflation                          | Stimulative               | **(1)** Short-term rates low or declining; **(2)** Long-term rates bottomingand bond prices peaking; **(3)** Stock prices increasing |
| Early expansion  | Low inflation and good economic growth                 | Becoming less stimulative | **(1)** Short-term rates increasing; **(2)** Long-term rates bottomingor increasing with bondprices beginning to decline; **(3)** Stock prices increasing |
| Late expansion   | Inflation rate increasing                              | Becoming restrictive      | **(1)** Short-term and long-term rates increasing with bond prices declining; **(2)** Stock prices peaking and volatile |
| Slowdown         | Inflation continues to accelerate                      | Becoming less restrictive | **(1)** Short-term and long-term rates peaking and then declining with bond prices starting to increase; **(2)** Stock prices declining |
| Contraction      | Real economic activity declining and inflation peaking | Easing                    | **(1)** Short-term and long-term rates declining with bond prices increasing; **(2)** Stock prices begin to increase later in the recession |

#### Buy

- **Inflation within expectations:** 
  1. Cash equivalents: Earn the real rate of interest
  2. Bonds: Shorter-term yields more volatile than longer-term yields
  3. Equity: No impact given predictable economic growth (已经反映在预期中 )
  4. Real estate: Neutral impact with typical rates of return
- **Inflation above or below expectations:**
  1. Cash equivalents: Positive (negative) impact with increasing (decreasing) yields 
  2. Bonds: Longer-term yields more volatile than shorter-term yields 
  3. Equity: Negative impact given the potential for central bank action or falling asset prices, though some companies may be able to pass rising costs on to customers
  4. Real estate: Positive impact as real asset values increase with inflation
- **Deflation:**
  1. Cash equivalents: Positive impact if nominal interest rates are bound by 0% 
  2. Bonds: Positive impact as fixed future cash flows have greater purchasing power (assuming no default on the bonds) 
  3. Equity: Negative impact as economic activity and business declines 
  4. Real estate: Negative impact as property values generally decline

### Policy Impacts

#### Monetary Policy

- Taylor Rules

  $r_{policy } = r^* + \frac{1}{2} (\pi-{\pi}^*) +\frac{1}{2}(Y-Y^*)$

- Negative Interest Rate

  - few comparable periods, 因为 negative interest rate 的历史数据样本小，所以用历史数据估计未来，估计不准确 
  - it means significant structural changes

  如何处理负利率的情况？

  1. 用 neutral rate 替代负利率
  2. 不处理

#### Fiscal Policy

- Consider the **changes in the budget deficits**, not absolute value.

- **Crowding out Effects**: rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates [private sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp) spending.

- **Automatic Stabliser**: 

  1. Progressive Tax: 

     Expansion => Income increase => tax increase => consumption decrease

  2. Mean-based **transfer payment** 转移支付

     recession => transfer payment 补贴 => consumption increase => stimualte the econ

#### Monetary + Fiscal Policy

$ i = \pi + r$

- Monetary Policy 影响 $\pi$ , inflation
- Fiscal Policy 影响 $r$ , real interest rate

#### Impacts on Yield Curve

- If both policies are stimulative, the yield curve is steep and the economy is likely to grow.
- If both policies are restrictive, the yield curve is inverted and the economy is likely to contract.
- If monetary policy is restrictive and fiscal policy is stimulative, the yield curve is flat and the implications for the economy are less clear.
- If monetary policy is stimulative and fiscal policy is restrictive, the yield curve is moderately steep and the implications for the economy are less clear.

###  International Consideration

If **Current Account Surplus**, => Net Export (export > import), => capital inflow 资本流入（钱流入国内）foreign reserve increase 外储增加, => 用外储USD投资海外资产 => 资本外流 => **Capital Account Deficits**

反之

If **Current Account Deficits**, Import > Export, 需要借外汇来进口, **Capital Account inflow (Surplus)**

- Therefore, Current Account & Captial Account negative correlated

### Interest Rate/Exchange Rate Linkages

$Y = C+I+G +NX$

$NX = Y-C-I-G$

by $Y-T = C+S$, so $Y-C = S+T$

Thus, $NX = \underbrace{S-I}_{\text{Net Private Saving}} + \underbrace{T-G}_{\text{Government Surplus}}$

##### Peg 一国汇率peg另一国

- The linkage between the business cycles of the two economies will increase, as the pegged currency country must follow the economic policies of the country to which it has pegged its currency. 两国的经济政策必须一致，否则peg不住
- The interest rates of the pegged currency will exceed the interest rates of the currency to which it is linked, and the interest rate differential will fluctuate with the market’s confidence in the peg. 利差会导致peg不住

##### 不可能三角

- Unrestricted Capital Flow 自由的资本流动
- Fixed Exchange Rate 
- Independent Monetary Policy

## Forecast Asset Class Return

### Fixed Income

#### DCF Approach

 $P_0 = \sum \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} $

- $r = YTM$, there are three assumption about YTM, 只要违背这三个assumption，那么估值不准确
  1. Hold to Maturity 持有至到期
  2. No Default 不违约
  3. reinvest at YTM 以YTM的rate再投资

- $r = \text{coupon rate} + \text{Re-Investmen} + \Delta P$

  - if **market rate** increase, 

    1. then $\Delta P$ decrease. => **Price Risks** increase 
    2. $RI$ increase. 再投资 CF 的收益提升 => **re-investment risks** decrease

    - *vice versa*

  - **Duration Gap = "MI" = Maculy Duration - Investment Period**

    - if DG > 0, Daculy Duration is larger, price risks dominates. Thus, market rate increase, impacts of $\Delta P$ > impacts of $RI$, => thus $r$ increase

#### Risk Premium Approach

$r = r_f + TP + CP + LP$

- **risk free rate**: short term 因为如果是长期的就不需要term premium, similarly risk-free rate without TP CP LP risks

  - **T-bill rate, if negative interest rate**, then use **policy rate** replaced 
  - if term is mismatched 如果期限错配, use **Future Contract Rate** (forward rate, or future rate)

- **Term premium**

  1. **Inflation Uncertainty**

     **The term structure is postively correlated with inflation uncertainty**

      $TP = r_{longTerm} - r_{shortTerm}$

  ​	$ST \ inflation: i = \theta$ <- expected inflation

  ​	$LT\ inflation: i = \theta + \pi$ <- expected inf + **uncertainty inf**

  ​	$r_{LT} = l + \theta + \pi$  real interest rate + inflation

  ​	$r_{SL} = l + \theta$   real interest rate + inflation

  ​	$TP \sim \pi$ 

  2. **Recession Hedge**

     衰退 -> buy T-bond ->  long-term bond price increase -> $r_{LT}$ decrease

     $TP = r_{LP} - r_{ST}$ decrase

  3. **Supply and Demand**

     Long-term bond demand > supply, price incerase, $r_{LT}$ decrease

     $TP = r_{LP} - r_{ST}$ decrase

  4. **Business Cycles**: Slope of the yield curve

- **Credit premium**

  1. **Expected Loss** = PD * LGD   <- Prob of Loss * Loss Given Default

     LGD increase -> CP increase

  2. **Default Risks**: Default Risks increase increase, CP increase

  3. **Credit Rating**: Low Credit Rating -> high credit premium

  - Emperical Finding: Default Risk has the majority among those three

- **Liquidity premium**

  the LP is higher if the bonds are:

  1. issued at close to par or market rates, 
  2. new, 
  3. large in size, 
  4. issued by a frequent and well-known issuer, 
  5. simple in structure, and 
  6. of high credit quality.

### Equity Return

#### GK model (DCF) - Supply Side (from the firm side)

GGM -> 3 steps -> GK model

$GGM: r_e = \frac{D_1}{P_0}+g$

- **Step 1**: **Expected Cash Flow Returns** 调Repurchase

  因为 Dividend Yield: Cash Div + Repurchase

  其中回购越多，对share holders越好，因为share被浓缩了，同时因为 $\% \Delta S$ 本身是负数，所以

  调增为 $-\% \Delta S$

- **Step 2**: **The Expected Nominal Earning Growth** $\%\Delta E$

  $\%\Delta E = g_{real} + \pi$  , real growth + inflation

  we use the nominal earning growth of the firm, not the country

- **Step 3**: **Repricing Return**: $\% \Delta P/E$

- Thus, $r_e = \frac{D_1}{P_0} - \%\Delta S + g_{real} + \%\Delta P/E$

##### Pros and Cons

- Pros: 考虑了 **(1) Repurchase, (2) Nominal Growth, (3) Repricing Return**
- Cons: the model assume **infinite time horizon**
  - coz in the long run, $\%\Delta P/E = 0$ and $\%\Delta S =0$

#### ST model (risk premium) - Demand Side (from the consumer side)

CAPM -> internation CAPM

$r_i = r_f + \beta [\mathbb{E}(r_m) - r_f ]$

$r_i - r_f = RP = \beta (r_m - r_f) = \frac{cov_{i,m}}{\sigma^2_m}(r_m - r_f)$

$r_i - r_f = \rho_{i,m} \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}(r_m - r_f)$

$RP = r_i - r_f = \rho\ \sigma _m SR_m$ by $SR _m = \frac{r_m - r_f}{\sigma_m}$

- M: Global Market Portfolio (GMP)

  - $\phi \in [0,1]$, the degree to which the asset is globally integrated. $\phi \sim 1$ more integrated to the global market, $\phi \sim 0$ more separate

  **Steps of ST Model**

  - **Step 1**: Fully integtated: $\phi = 1$, $RP_{integrated} = r_i - r_f = \rho\ \sigma _m SR_m$
  - **Step 2:** Fully Seperate: $\phi = 0$ , and because of fully seperation, asset classes are not and cannot be diversified, so $\rho = 1$, so $RP_{seperated} = r_i - r_f = \sigma _m SR_m$
  - **Step 3**: True RP is the weighted average, $RP = \phi RP_{I} + (1-\phi )RP_S$
  - **Step 4**: $r_i = r_f + RP$

###  Real Estate

**illiquidy**, **hetergenous** (各个不一样), **maintainance and operation cost**, **Appreaisals**

- Real Estate Cycles: high quality properties are less cyclical, low quality properties are more cyclical 

#### DCF

In level II

$V_0 = \frac{NOI_1}{r-g}$ => $r = \frac{NOI_1}{V_0} + g$

We get to the formula by composing three parts

1. Cap Rate: $\frac{NOI_1}{V_0}$, 经营带来的 income return
2. $g_{nominal} = g_{realNOI} + \pi $
3. $-\%\Delta CapRate$ **repricing**, coz $\text{Capital Gain} = \frac{V_1 - V_0}{V_0}$ 但是因为 估值上升 即 V 提升带来的 Capital Gain 会使 Captial Rate 在分母的 V 变大。所以 Capital Gain & Capital Rate are negative correlated.

$r = CapRate + NOI \ growth - \%\Delta CapRate$

##### Factors Affecting the Cap Rate 

- Interest rate increase => NOI increase => Cap Rate increase
- vacancy rate increase => $V_0$ decrease => Cap Rate Increase
- availability of credit and debts 信贷多，买房多demand of houses increase => $V_0$ increase => Cap Rate decrease

#### Risk Premium

CF of real estate = 租金 + Cap Gain增值

$r_{house} = r_f + TP + CP + EP + LP$

term premium, credit premium, equilty risk premium (cap gain), liquidity premium

##### REITs

- strongly correlated with equity in the **short term**
- only correlated with direct real estate in the **long term**
- REITs use significant **leverage**, to make it compare with direct real estate, REITs should be unlevered first
- **after adjusting the leverage of REITs, it has higher return and low volatility**

###  Exchange Rate

#### Current Acount: Three factors

- **Trade Flows: small impacts**. As trade has normally has financial hedge, the effects are hedged. Large trade ﬂows without large financing ﬂows in foreign exchange markets likely indicates a crisis.
- **PPP: less impacts in short-term**. Inflation and exchange are correlated through UIP
- **Current Account: large impacts.** if 国内（本币）贵, import foreign, CA deficits 本币流出 未来本币贬值。vice versa.

#### Capital Mobility

by UIP, (e is in d/f) $e_1 -e_0 \approx r_d - r_f$, and then add premiums

$E(\%\Delta S_{d/f}) = (r_d -r_f) + (Term_d - Term_f) + (Credit_d - Credit_f )+ (Equity_d - Equity_f) + (Liquidity_d - Liquidity_f)$

- **Overshooting**

  本币过度升值。在超短期 domestic interest rate increase, => FDI increase, =>  FX increase more
