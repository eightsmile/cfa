# Alternative Investments for Portfolio Management

## Hedge Fund Strategy

### Equity Strategy 

#### Long/Short Equity

- Extract Alpha return,
- Return is similar as long-only approach, but standard deviation is 50% lower because short parts hedge risks.
- May have leverage.

##### Dedicated Short Selling and Short-biased

- Look for poorly managed and overvalued companies 如 浑水
- Activist short selling 在short后出报告
- Typically take a bottom-up approach
- the stock’s **high short-interest ratio** and **high cost to borrow** (“on special”) are very concerning. Both factors suggest significant potential that a dangerous **short-squeeze situation**.

##### Equity Market Neutral

- Construct a **zero beta portfolio**, so i**mmune to market risk**, **earn only alpha**
- Types:
    1. Pairs Trading: two stocks hedge each other
    2. Stub Trading: long short subsidiary and parent
    3. Multi-class Trading: long short mispriced share classes of the same firm
- The **availability** and **cost of leverage** are considered in terms of desired return profile and acceptable potential portfolio drawdown risk.
- Low return, because market neutral. 
- Short horizon and active trading, so highly diversified and liquid
- **High leverage**. EMN strategies typically do not meet regulatory leverage limits for mutual fund vehicles. So, **limited partnerships** are the preferred vehicle.
- Work well when the market is vulnerable and weak.

### Event-Driven Strategy

#### Merger Arbitrage

- A: Acquirer
- T: Target

##### Cash-for-Stock

Buy target, T

##### Stock-for-Stock

Buy share of T, sell share of A. Because A issue share to buy T, then share price to A decrease, and demand of A stock increase, so A price increase.

Overall Characteristics:

- If the deals fail, this strategy has market sensitivity and left-tail risk attributes.
- The preferred vehicle is **limited partnership** because of merger arbitrage’s use of significant **leverage**, but some low-leverage, lowvolatility liquid alts merger arbitrage funds do exist.
    - typically apply 3 to 5 times leverage in order to achieve lowdouble-digit returns.
- Kind diversified, because the Acquirer and Target together is a composite, pretty much irrelevant with other portfolio. Thus, diversified.

#### Distressed Securities

Focus on firms that are (1) in bankruptcy, (2) under financial stress. Focus on:

- Recovery Value
- Undervalued Debt Securities

Characteristics:

- High return, but return is cyclical. The distressed securities strategy works better under postive Econ environment.
- High level of illiquidity
- Low leverage

### Relative Value Strategy

#### Fixed-Income Arbitrage

- Yield Curve Trades: taking long and short positions at different points on the yield curve
- Carry Trades: long a higher yielding security and shorting a lower yielding security

**Return profile is like put option.**

- If the strategy unfolds as expected, it returns a positive carry plus a profit from spread narrowing.
- If the spread unexpectedly widens, then the payoff becomes negative.

#### Convertible Bond Arbitrage

Convertible bond = straight debt + long equity call option

- Conversion value = stock price * conversion ratio
    - If conversion value > bond value, then in-the-market
    - Vice versa
- Conversion ration = # of share a bond can exchange

Convertible bond is complex structured, so generally under-valued. **Buy Convertible bond, short corresponding # of stocks.**

### Opportunistic Hedge Fund

#### Global Macro Strategy

- Top-down, fundamental model
- Heterogeneity 包括多种 assets 特异
- leveraged

#### Managed Futures

- exotic contract: furtures on weather / derivatives on carbon emission, etc.
- time-series momentum trend / cross-sectional momentum

#### Characteristics

- both: Derivative 多 -> leverage 多 -> 风险多，volatility 
- Both: 但是因为有derivatives可以hedge 风险，所以当经济差的时候 left tail的风险可控，暴露right-tail risks
- Both are highly liquid

- **Managed futures** take more **systematic approach**
- **global macro managers** are **more discretionary**

### Specialist Strategies

#### Volatility Trading

Source and buy cheap volatility and sell more expensive volatility while

#### Reinsurance and Life Settlements

- insurance contracts are not liquid and difficult to sell.
- the insurance and reinsurance themselves are independent with the market, so uncorrelated with the equity mkt. Thus, diversified

## Sum

### EMN

赚 alpha，beta = 0， 

整个组合不承担  system risks, 不承担 unsystem risk， 组合总风险低

特点：

- return: moderest
- sigma: low 因为只有非系统风险
- Leverage: 因为要做beta=0，所以会加杠杆。同时因为risks低，所以要加杠杆才能放大收益

### Merger Arbitrage

long T, short A

特点：

- expose to **left-tail** risks，因为若失败了，损失格外大
- Leverage：高杠杆（只要是arbitrage的，都高杠杆）一般3-5倍

### Convertible Bond

long Convertible Bond, short stock

Profit: CF

特点：

- Liquidity: long 方 因为结构复杂，所以需求低 liquidity 差。short方 cost 大
- leverage 高
- 适用条件 moderrate波动的

### FOF Multi-Fund 对比

### Conditional Factor Risk Model

reg HF return on 

1. Equity Risks (S&P500) 整个市场的风险
2. Currency Risks (USD) 外汇风险
3. Credit Risks (CREDIT) 债券风险
4. Volatility Risks (VIX) Options风险

### Empirical Results

#### Risk-Adjusted Measure

- high Sharpe and Sortino Ratio 指标好的策略

    1. Systematic Futures
    2. Equity Market Neutral
    3. Global Macro
    4. Event Driven Hedge Fund Strategy

- Do not enhance risk-adjusted performance 指标不好的策略

    1. FoF
    2. Multi-Strategy

    - 因为 分散风险 risk 降低，所以 return 也降低了

#### Drawdown

the higher the drawdown, the greater the **tail risks**

- Event-driven (MA) 策略，是为了挣 high earning，若MA失败，会暴露大 tail-risks
- Relative Value: 因为high leverage, 所以 market volatile 会带来大drawdown

## Alternative Investment

### Timber

- Earn: Capital Growth, Inflation Resistance
- Risks: Even Risks <- Insurance

### Commodity * 4

1. Metals
2. Energy
3. Livestock/ Meat
4. Agriculture

Invest in  (1) future (2) 实物 farmland 

### Investment Consideration

- **Risk Characterisitcs**

    1. MVO might be s.t. constarints
    2. Returns are not normally dist
    3. Might not be able to allocate assets as target

- **Establishing Return Expectation**

    1. limited data availability

- **Investment vehicle**

    - LP 出钱，GP 管理 参与运营

    1. Large investors, invest in LP
    2. FoF <- lack of enpertise investors (pros: access and diversify, cons: additional fees layer)
    3. Seperately Managed Accounts (SMA, funds of one) 由GP独立管理，专户管理，给 large investors
    4. Open-ended Mutual Funds and UCITS, give smaller investors access to alternatives 降低准入门槛，给小invetors

- Liquidity

    - Notation:

        1. Commitment 承诺出资，如commit 10b
        2. Call 召款，相当于花3年把10万投完，每投一笔之前都要 call
        3. Calldown Period，相当于召款周期

        - Commited Captial （10b） = Paid in Capital （已经call的，已经投入的） + 未投的

        4. Distribution

    - Drawdown Structure

        1. Captial Call and Distribtuion do not have predertermined schedule , 打款和提款的时间都没有确定
        2. Opportunity, risks of missing a capital call 没办法按时打款，而错过投资机会的风险
        3. Side-Pocket. 侧袋账户。普通账户的钱可以按redemption polcy赎回，但是 side pocket的不行。所以 若 side pocket钱越多，则流动性越大

    - Types:

        1. Event-driven Strategy: frequent redemption period
        2. Relative value funds: hold significant portions of illiquid investments,
        3. Leverage: Margin calls may force a leveraged fund to sell its most liquid holdings 

- Expense and Fee

    - 2/20

- Tax Consideration

- Build v.s. Buy

### Suitablility

- Investment Horizon: long
- Enterprise: Skilled Manager
- Governance: formal investment policy
- Transparency: low

In sum, alternatives are suitable to high risk tolerance investors.

### Approach to Asset Allocation

- Monte Carlo Simulation 
- MVO
    - establish limits
    - incorporate downside risks (mean-CVAR optimisation)
    - consider skewness
    - Cons: sensitive to small change of inputs 
- Risk Factor Based Optimisation

### Liquidity Planning

#### NAV 

NAV net asset value 资产净值 , by BASE

$NAV_e = NAV_b +A - S$

A: Contributon 打款 <- Call, $C\% \times 未投入 = C\%\times (CC-PIC)$, commited capital - paid-in capital

S: Return 收益 <- Distribution, $D\%$

$NAV_e = NAV_b + g\times NAV_b + C\%(C-PIC) - D\% \times NAV_b(1+g)$

$NAV_e = NAV_b(1+g)(1-D\%) + C\% (CC-PIC)$

#### Avoid Cash Drag

为了保证 call 的时候有钱可以投进去，又避免持有 cash 导致 return过低。

在 call 之前，把准备投

1. 投 PE 的钱，投 Public Equity
2. 投 RE 的钱，投 REITs

#### Prepare for Unexpectation (Stress-test)

Stree test for unexpectred events 

### Performance Evaluation

- MWRR (IRR) , Cons 受CF出现的时间点影响，只考虑了 percentage 没考虑 Value Amount

- $MOIC = \frac{Cummulative Distribution}{Paid-inCapital} = \frac{D_1 + D_2 + D_3}{C_1+C_2 +C_3}$

    直接把现金流相加，不折现。Pros: 不受CF时点影响，Cons: 但是没考虑Time Value of Money
