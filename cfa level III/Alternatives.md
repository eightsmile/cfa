# Alternative Investments for Portfolio Management

## Hedge Fund Strategy

### Equity Strategy 

#### Long/Short Equity

- Extract Alpha return,
- Return is similar as long-only approach, but standard deviation is 50% lower because short parts hedge risks.
- May have leverage.

##### Dedicated Short Selling and Short-biased

- Look for poorly managed and overvalued companies 如 浑水
- Activist short selling 在short后出报告
- Typically take a bottom-up approach
- the stock’s **high short-interest ratio** and **high cost to borrow** (“on special”) are very concerning. Both factors suggest significant potential that a dangerous **short-squeeze situation**.

##### Equity Market Neutral

- Construct a **zero beta portfolio**, so i**mmune to market risk**, **earn only alpha**
- Types:
    1. Pairs Trading: two stocks hedge each other
    2. Stub Trading: long short subsidiary and parent
    3. Multi-class Trading: long short mispriced share classes of the same firm
- The **availability** and **cost of leverage** are considered in terms of desired return profile and acceptable potential portfolio drawdown risk.
- Low return, because market neutral. 
- Short horizon and active trading, so highly diversified and liquid
- **High leverage**. EMN strategies typically do not meet regulatory leverage limits for mutual fund vehicles. So, **limited partnerships** are the preferred vehicle.
- Work well when the market is vulnerable and weak.

### Event-Driven Strategy

#### Merger Arbitrage

- A: Acquirer
- T: Target

##### Cash-for-Stock

Buy target, T

##### Stock-for-Stock

Buy share of T, sell share of A. Because A issue share to buy T, then share price to A decrease, and demand of A stock increase, so A price increase.

Overall Characteristics:

- If the deals fail, this strategy has market sensitivity and left-tail risk attributes.
- The preferred vehicle is **limited partnership** because of merger arbitrage’s use of significant **leverage**, but some low-leverage, lowvolatility liquid alts merger arbitrage funds do exist.
    - typically apply 3 to 5 times leverage in order to achieve lowdouble-digit returns.
- Kind diversified, because the Acquirer and Target together is a composite, pretty much irrelevant with other portfolio. Thus, diversified.

#### Distressed Securities

Focus on firms that are (1) in bankruptcy, (2) under financial stress. Focus on:

- Recovery Value
- Undervalued Debt Securities

Characteristics:

- High return, but return is cyclical. The distressed securities strategy works better under postive Econ environment.
- High level of illiquidity
- Low leverage

### Relative Value Strategy

#### Fixed-Income Arbitrage

- Yield Curve Trades: taking long and short positions at different points on the yield curve
- Carry Trades: long a higher yielding security and shorting a lower yielding security

**Return profile is like put option.**

- If the strategy unfolds as expected, it returns a positive carry plus a profit from spread narrowing.
- If the spread unexpectedly widens, then the payoff becomes negative.

#### Convertible Bond Arbitrage

Convertible bond = straight debt + long equity call option

- Conversion value = stock price * conversion ratio
    - If conversion value > bond value, then in-the-market
    - Vice versa
- Conversion ration = # of share a bond can exchange

Convertible bond is complex structured, so generally under-valued. **Buy Convertible bond, short corresponding # of stocks.**
